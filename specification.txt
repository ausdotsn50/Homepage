How I chose to use Javascript and Bootstrap
    - I mainly used bootstrap for the container thing
    so everything is in place whether for desktop
    or mobile. I also utilized its grid thing (using
    row and col classes). Moreover, made use of one of its
    default for navigation bar, and just modified it on
    my own.

    - As for javascript, I used it mainly in the about and contact page.
    In the about page, I used it to make a piano display for my information.
    For the contact page, I used it for submitting the form, printing in console,
    adding options to dropdown list, etc.
